                        Rowling. The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter,

                        at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns
                        Harry's quest to overcome the Dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who aims to become
                        immortal, enslave humanity, and destroy all non-magical beings. The final
                        novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was released on 21 July 200
                        7, and sold 11 million copies in the first 24 hours of its release.
                        The series has also had a massive impact on popular culture and was
                        listed in a 2007 BBC poll on the UK's Best Loved Books. At the time
                        of the last publication in 2007, the series, collectively known as the
                        Harry Potter book series, had sold over 400 million copies, been translated
                        into 67 languages, and the last four books have consecutively set records
                        as the fastest-selling books in history.</h2>

                <p><h2>Book Name: Crime and Punishment</h2><h2>Author: Fyodor Dostoevsky</h2></p>
                <h2>"Crime and Punishment" by Fyodor Dostoevsky is a psychological drama set in St. Petersburg, Russia.
                    <br> The novel follows Rodion Raskolnikov, a destitute former student who rationalizes that he can 
                    transcend morality to perform a "necessary" murder. He kills a pawnbroker, Alyona Ivanovna, but is 
                    haunted by guilt and paranoia. His mental turmoil deepens as he interacts with various characters, 
                    including his family, the virtuous prostitute Sonia, and the astute detective Porfiry. Sonia represents 
                    redemption, urging Raskolnikov towards confession and spiritual awakening. The relentless Porfiry subtly
                    pressures Raskolnikov, leading to his eventual confession. The novel explores themes of morality, justice,
                    and redemption, examining the psychological impact of crime. Raskolnikov’s journey from hubris to humility underscores Dostoevsky’s 
                    exploration of the human condition, ultimately suggesting that true punishment and salvation are internal processes driven by one's 
                    conscience and faith.</h2>
