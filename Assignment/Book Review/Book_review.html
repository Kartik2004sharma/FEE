        <span>Harry Potter</span> <br>
        <span>Harry Potter is a series of fantasy novels written by British author J. K.
            Rowling. The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter,
            and his friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students
            at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc concerns
            Harry's quest to overcome the Dark wizard Lord Voldemort, who aims to become
            immortal, enslave humanity, and destroy all non-magical beings. The final
            novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was released on 21 July 200
            7, and sold 11 million copies in the first 24 hours of its release.
            The series has also had a massive impact on popular culture and was
            listed in a 2007 BBC poll on the UK's Best Loved Books. At the time
            of the last publication in 2007, the series, collectively known as the
            Harry Potter book series, had sold over 400 million copies, been translated
            into 67 languages, and the last four books have consecutively set records
            as the fastest-selling books in history.</span>
